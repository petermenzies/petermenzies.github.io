In this role, I’m analyzing\nquantitative and spatial data in order to generate this year’s OHI\nscores. Moving forward, I’m interested in using my data science skill\nset to support emerging projects in the environmental technology\nsector—particularly those geared towards climate change mitigation.\nI’m originally from North Carolina, where I studied ecology at the\nUniversity of North Carolina – Asheville among the southern Appalachian\nmountains. During this time I entered the realm of environmental\nresearch as an intern with the US Forest Service, conducting field work\nfor several studies concerning eastern hemlock decline. Continuing along\nthis path, I pursued undergraduate research looking at the\nhabitat preferences of two orchid\nspecies, and spent another field season collecting and analyzing\ndata for a forest regeneration study with NC State University. Wanting\nto try my hand at education and to get more involved in my community, I\nspent nearly three years as the Environmental Educator for a small\nnonprofit in Asheville. During this time I started teaching myself to\ncode and was drawn to the idea of applying data science techniques to\ncombat environmental issues. I discovered the MEDS program at the Bren\nSchool, and have been in Santa Barbara ever since.\n\n\n\n",

Menzies, Irene M.\nRossell\nSoutheastern Naturalist,\n16(3): (2017). https://doi.org/10.1656/058.016.0317\nAbstract\nAplectrum hyemale (Puttyroot) and Tipularia\ndiscolor (Cranefly Orchid) are wintergreen orchids native to the\neastern and central United States. Plants of both species produce leaves\nin the fall, photosynthesize during the winter, and persist as\nunderground corms during the summer. Odocoileus virginianus\n(White-tailed Deer) are implicated as the main predator of both orchids,\nalthough little information is available regarding herbivory of these or\nother wintergreen species. We observed early emerging overwintering\nnymphs of the spur-throated grasshopper Melanoplus acrophilus\non leaves of Puttyroot and Cranefly Orchids in a forested site in\nwestern North Carolina. This is the first account of potential insect\nherbivory on these winter green orchids.\nCitation\nPeter F. Menzies and Irene M.

Clabby, Peter Menzies\nThe\nJ. of the Torrey Botanical Society, 144(4):417-422 (2017). https://doi.org/10.3159/TORREY-D-16-00039.1\nAbstract\nAplectrum hyemale and Tipularia discolor are\nwintergreen orchids native to the eastern and central United States.\nEach produces a single leaf in late fall that persists through the\nwinter and senesces in early spring. Both species occur in scattered\npatches in the understory of deciduous forests, and although they\noverlap in range and often co-occur in the landscape, their habitat and\nphotosynthetic potential have not been compared directly. In this study\nwe examine the relative abundance of A. hyemale and T.\ndiscolor in western North Carolina and quantify habitat\ncharacteristics and levels of leaf chlorophyll for each species. We\nconducted broad-scale surveys (walkabouts) of seven sites in Pisgah\nNational Forest during the winter and collected habitat data in 26\npatches of each species in one mesic forest. Both species shared similar\nhabitat attributes at this site (plants located ∼ 2 m from overstory\ntrees of similar diameter in ∼ 45% sunlight). However, across all sites,\nT. discolor was three times more abundant than A.\nhyemale, more likely to occur in large patches (> 20 plants),\nand more consistently distributed across a range of slope aspects. In\ncontrast, A. hyemale occurred most often on slopes facing\n91–180°, and at elevations > 750 m. Whereas A. hyemale was\nmost often associated with Liriodendron tulipifera overstory\ntrees, T. discolor was often in close proximity to Quercus\nspp. as well as L. tulipifera. Leaf chlorophyll was twice\nas high in A. hyemale, which could support differences in\nphotosynthetic strategies, or reflect differences in leaf size and\nmorphology.\nCitation\nIrene M.
