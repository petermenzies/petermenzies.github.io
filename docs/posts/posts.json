    "contents": "\nLet’s create a simple function that outputs a statement containing a person’s name and the amount of change in their pocket given the number of each US coin they have\n\n\nspare_change <- function(friend, pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters) {\n\n  penny_val <- pennies * 0.01\n  nickel_val <- nickels * 0.05\n  dime_val <- dimes * 0.10\n  quarter_val <- quarters * 0.25\n\n  all_change <- sum(penny_val, nickel_val, dime_val, quarter_val)\n\n  return(paste(\"Your friend\", friend, \"has $\", all_change))\n}\n\n\n\nThis will work just fine, but that’s a lot of required arguments — we can make it a bit more user-friendly by prompting the user for input that will supply our arguments.\nThe readline() function takes input from the user which we can assign to an object. Within readline(), we define the argument prompt as the question or directive we want presented to the user. For example:\n\n\nfriend <- readline(prompt = \"what is your friend's name?\")\n\n\n\nIn the above example, friend is now assigned the value of whatever the user enters following the prompt.\nWe can use this same function to gather all the needed arguments for spare_change() by prompting the user for input. This will look like:\n\n\nspare_change <- function() {\n\n  friend <- readline(prompt = \"Enter a friend's name: \")\n  pennies <- as.numeric(readline(prompt = \"How many pennies do they have: \"))\n  nickels <- as.numeric(readline(prompt = \"How many nickels do they have: \"))\n  dimes <- as.numeric(readline(prompt = \"How many dimes do they have: \"))\n  quarters <- as.numeric(readline(prompt = \"How many quarters do they have: \"))\n\n  penny_val <- pennies * 0.01\n  nickel_val <- nickels * 0.05\n  dime_val <- dimes * 0.10\n  quarter_val <- quarters * 0.25\n\n  all_change <- sum(penny_val, nickel_val, dime_val, quarter_val)\n\n  return(paste(\"Your friend\", friend, \"has $\", all_change))\n}\n\n\n\nIt’s important to note that readline() returns a string, so for our coin value calculations, we had to convert the user’s input to a numeric value.\nOur function now requires no arguments when called — it will gather them from the user. Our user can run the function without using the documentation to determine what arguments are needed.\n\n\n\n",
