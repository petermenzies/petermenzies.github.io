I’m currently a masters student pursuing a degree in Environmental Data Science at UC Santa Barbara’s Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. I spent my undergraduate years studying Ecology and Field Biology at the University of North Carolina at Asheville. My entry into the realm of environmental research began with a technician position with the US Forest Service, conducting field work for hemlock woolly adelgid studies. Following this path, I pursued my own undergraduate research looking at the habitat preferences of two orchid species in Western North Carolina, and spent another field season collecting and analyzing data for a forest gap and regeneration study through NC State University. Wanting to try my hand at education and get more involved in my community, I spent nearly three years as the Environmental Educator for a small nonprofit in Asheville. During this time I started teaching myself to code and found myself drawn to the idea of applying data science techniques to combat environmental issues. I hope to use the environmental data science degree I’m working towards to assess the use of emerging technologies in the fight against climate change.
